# Genesis

This app was created with Spring.io - tips on working with the code [can be found here](https://start.spring.io/)).
Feel free to contact us for further questions.

## Development

Update your local database connection in `application.yml` or create your own `application-local.yml` file to override
settings for development.

During development it is recommended to use the profile `local`. In IntelliJ `-Dspring.profiles.active=local` can be
added in the VM options of the Run Configuration after enabling this property in "Modify options".

Lombok must be supported by your IDE. For IntelliJ install the Lombok plugin and enable annotation processing -

After starting the application it is accessible under `localhost:8080`.
